# Handicap_Calculator
A tool that allows you to save scores and calculate a handicap over time. The collects 3 items from the user: their score, their course rating, and their course slope. The program uses these inputs to calculate a differential which is then stored on a file. Once 5 scores have been recorded, a handicap can be calculated. The beauty of this program is that it allows you to record your scores over time by using file I/O instead of having to enter in multiple score from different rounds played.
